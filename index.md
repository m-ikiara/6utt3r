title: '6utt3r: The Ray-casting Engine'
---

## üßà Getting Started

1. Clone the repo using either of the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/brian-ikiara/6utt3r.git
```

2. Navigate into the new directory and execute the following:

```console
$ make -B
$ ./butt3r start
```

3. Use the mouse and `WASD` key-bindings for movement around the basic map.

## üçÄ The possibilities are endless!

Head over to `src/` and play around with the code. You can implement Procedural Generation if you'd like. Maybe even define your own Ray-tracing Algorithms and replace `raycasting.cpp`. Have a go at it.
