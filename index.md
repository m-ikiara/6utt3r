title: '6utt3r: The Ray-casting Engine'
---

## üßà Getting Started

1. Clone the repo using the following command:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/m-ikiara/6utt3r.git
```
2. Navigate into the new directory and execute the following:

```console
$ make -B -j3
$ ./6utt3r
```
## üçÄ The possibilities are endless!

Head over to `/src` and play around with the code. You can implement Procedural Generation if you'd like...maybe even define your own Shortest path Algorithms and replace or implement your own `raycasting.{c,cpp,cxx}`. Have a go at it.
